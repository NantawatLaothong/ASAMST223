This was a dark period in American history where approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, including men, women, and children, were forcibly removed from their homes and placed into internment camps. The act was fueled by anti-Japanese sentiment and racial prejudice, despite the fact that the majority of Japanese Americans posed no threat to national security. The internment of Japanese Americans was a gross violation of their civil liberties and fundamental human rights. The legacy of Executive Order 9066 serves as a reminder of the dangers of prejudice, racism, and the importance of protecting civil liberties and human rights for all individuals.</p>"

They faced discrimination and prejudice, but they also found work in mining and other industries. By 1870, the Chinese population in California had grown to over 63,000, making up about 8% of the state's population. Chinese immigrants made significant contributions to the development of California and the United States, particularly in agriculture, railroads, and mining. However, they also faced widespread discrimination and violence, culminating in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which severely restricted Chinese immigration to the United States.</p>"

Chinese laborers were hired by the Central Pacific Railroad Company, which was responsible for building the western portion of the railroad, and they made up a majority of the workforce. The Chinese workers faced harsh working conditions and discrimination, but they were instrumental in completing the railroad on schedule. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad with Chinese labor was a significant achievement in American engineering and transportation, but it also highlighted the mistreatment and exploitation of Chinese immigrants in the United States during that time period.</p>"

The agreement was not a formal treaty, but rather a series of diplomatic notes between the two countries. It effectively reduced the number of Japanese immigrants to the US, particularly laborers, for several years. However, it did not prevent Japanese immigration altogether, and it also sparked controversy in both countries. The Gentlemen's Agreement was terminated in 1924 with the passage of the Immigration Act, which effectively banned all Asian immigration to the US.</p>"

The Alien Land Law remained in effect in California until it was repealed in 1956, after the Supreme Court ruled that it violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>"
